📊 Python Data Analysis Projects
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate Python projects focused on analyzing real-world datasets.
The emphasis is on transforming cleaned data into insights through exploration, statistics, and visualization.

Each notebook follows a structured analysis workflow similar to what junior data analysts use in real projects.

🧠 Business Questions Addressed

Across the projects in this repository, the analysis focuses on questions such as:

What trends and patterns exist in the data?

How do key variables relate to each other?

What does the data reveal through summary statistics?

Which insights are most relevant for decision-making?

How can results be clearly communicated through visuals?
