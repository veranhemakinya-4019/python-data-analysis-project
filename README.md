# Python Data Analysis – Sales Performance Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow using Python to extract actionable business insights from a sales dataset. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insight-driven recommendations.

The goal is to show how raw data can be transformed into clear insights that support data-driven decision-making.
